We analyze individual situations and target advice, based on recognized best practices, to the client&rsquo;s needs.</p>\r\n<h2>Coaching for High-potential Talent</h2>\r\n<p>Given the cost of finding and retaining talent that&rsquo;s qualified to meet the demands of today&rsquo;s workplace, organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of identifying their high-performers and using professional coaches to prepare them for successful advancement. When a new leader is prepared for what to expect and the organization knows what that leader needs, the savings in overall productivity is likely to be greater than the investment in coaching.</p>\r\n<p>We work with managers and human resources departments to plan advancement tracks for promising employees. We coach individuals to identify and strengthen the skills they need succeed at their next step.</p>\r\n<h2>Coaching for Groups and Teams</h2>\r\n<p>From boards of directors to project directors, working groups have special needs, particularly with the recent focus on achieving a better balance between solo work and shared work. We stimulate groups to set clear expectations for the whole and for each individual member, improve focus, balance power, and optimize use of resources.</p>\r\n<h2>How We Work</h2>\r\n<p>Our strategy is to collaborate with the client to assess the present situation, define needs and opportunities, develop goals and plans to achieve them, and measure progress. Our role is to provide ideas, appropriately paced practical advice, and ongoing support. Clients report performance gains based clarity of focus, commitment to goals, and confidence as a result of these professional relationships.</p>\r\n<p>Clients often ask us to create benchmarks by gathering feedback through solo interviews or focus groups. Those interviews are designed to identify themes and gaps in understanding without attributing any statement to a specific participant. In many cases we work solely with the individual, some of whom prefer that no one know they are being coached. We commit to confidentiality as part of our contract.</p>\r\n<p>The frequency and duration of coaching depends on the client&rsquo;s goals and time frame. Many choose to meet weekly; however, in some established relationships, Oliver Tessier &amp; Associates is brought in on an as-needed basis to advise and collaborate on specific issues.</p>\r\n</div>", "description": "<p>We are recognized for our ability to establish trust relationships with clients&mdash;the foundation of coaching&mdash;in very short periods of time.

Guided by the organization's mission and approved by its board, the strategic plan serves as a compass for making decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Successful strategic plans, those that get used, fit the needs of the organization and are readily accessible. They are simple enough that those involved see the relationship of the key strategies to the mission; they're focused enough to provide a consistent direction; yet they're broad enough to allow management some leeway in making operational decisions.</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\">\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were too caught up in the present to focus on the future. Now that we&rsquo;ve made a plan, everything is falling into place&mdash;including the finances.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>For nonprofits, approving the strategic plan is technically a function of the board. The level of staff participation in the development of the plan varies widely, but most organizations recognize the value of including the staff (and, sometimes, constituents).</p>\r\n<p>Oliver Tessier &amp; Associates will propose a strategic planning process that can be customized to your needs and resources. We will then manage the agreed-upon process, facilitate planning meetings, and make recommendations for a well-balanced plan with measurable outcomes. If you choose, we will draft the final form of the plan in presentation and distribution formats.</p>\r\n<h3>Operating Planning</h3>\r\n<p>The operating plan, or the annual business plan, is management's statement of the specific steps it will take in a given time period to support the direction set by the strategic plan.</p>\r\n<p>Ideally, the operating plan is management's first step in defining its goals for the next fiscal year. That plan becomes the guideline on which the annual operating budget is based, and it includes the indicators by which management performance will be measured.</p>\r\n<p>Once a structure is designed for the annual planning and budget process, it is easily integrated into routine operations, promoting awareness of planning and evaluation throughout all activities.</p>\r\n<p>Oliver Tessier &amp; Associates will help you develop a template for annual operating plans that you can use and refine each year. We are prepared to coordinate the work of participants in the planning process and to make recommendations that ensure the operating plan directly supports the strategic plan.</p>\r\n<h3>Our Involvement</h3>\r\n<p>The degree to which Oliver Tessier &amp; Associates is involved in your planning depends on you: for some clients, we do everything from the preliminary research to drafting the plan; for others we simply outline the process, facilitate the planning sessions, and provide a summary.</p>\r\n<h3>More Information</h3>\r\n<p>For more information visit the the <a href=\"/library\" target=\"_self\">Library</a>&nbsp; or use the Search feature at the top of the page.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "description": "<p>Strategic and operating plans that clearly establish your priorities&mdash;and work for your organization</p>", "title": "Planning", "created": "2014-12-29T02:42:42.497Z", "modified": "2015-01-02T23:32:35.144Z", "icon_name": "file-text", "position": 2, "short_description": "Strategic and operating plans that clearly establish your priorities.", "status_changed": "2014-12-29T02:42:42.497Z", "slug": "planning"}, "model": "consulting.practicearea", "pk": 9}, {"fields": {"status": "published", "body": "<p>Leaders have unique needs to convey their messages clearly, diplomatically, and with persuasive impact.

Some may&nbsp; feel awkward suggesting that a board improve its performance (particularly the CEO who reports to that board); however, assessing the board's performance and making recommendations for more effective, satisfying board service are contributions to the nonprofit's success.</p>\r\n<h3>Topics for Board Development</h3>\r\n<p>The foundation of successful nonprofit boards is a clear, shared understanding of what is expected of board members. The first step in developing that understanding is education about the obligations and duties of nonprofit boards. A frequent second step is negotiation among members of the board about the expectations within their nonprofit.</p>\r\n<p>Sample topics for board development include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The role and responsibilities of the board</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The role and responsibilities of officers and committees</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The importance of the nominating process, and how to achieve best results</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Fund raising and the board</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Managing board/board and board/staff relationships</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Assisting the board in confidential self-assessment of its own performance</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Boards respond well to having an expert they can question regarding differences of opinion about appropriate procedure and practices in the field. We have seen them make great strides as a result of having an independent professional help them gain greater understanding of their role.</p>\r\n<h3>Venues for Board Development</h3>\r\n<p>In-depth board development often takes place in a retreat setting, where participants are given extended opportunities to explore and refine their understanding of best practices. Some nonprofits prefer to integrate board development into their ongoing work; it can be as simple as a single event addressing a single topic or series of sessions that are part of board meetings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Oliver Tessier &amp; Associates can also help your organization design an orientation for new board members.</em></p>\r\n<h3>More information</h3>\r\n<p>For more information visit the the <a href=\"/library\" target=\"_self\">Library</a> or use the Search feature at the top of the page.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "description": "<p>Practical tools for building and maintaining effective boards.</p>", "title": "Board Development", "created": "2014-12-29T02:42:42.497Z", "modified": "2015-01-02T23:32:35.079Z", "icon_name": "line-chart", "position": 3, "short_description": "Practical tools for building and maintaining effective boards.", "status_changed": "2014-12-29T02:42:42.497Z", "slug": "board-development"}, "model": "consulting.practicearea", "pk": 13}, {"fields": {"status": "private", "body": "<p>x</p>", "description": "<p>x</p>", "title": "Secret", "created": "2015-01-03T08:07:12.079Z", "modified": "2015-01-03T08:07:12.082Z", "icon_name": "s", "position": 100, "short_description": "strategic and operating plans that clearly establish your priorities.", "status_changed": "2015-01-03T08:07:12.079Z", "slug": "secret"}, "model": "consulting.practicearea", "pk": 14}, {"fields": {"status": "published", "body": "<p>AIADA exists to protect the economic viability and represent the political interests of America&rsquo;s 10,000 international nameplate automobile dealerships.</p>", "position": 100, "description": "<p>Design and facilitation of a strategic planning retreat board and staff.</p>", "title": "AIADA", "url": "http://aiada.org/", "image": "clients/aiada.png", "created": "2014-12-29T04:54:27.345Z", "modified": "2015-01-05T04:06:58.293Z", "practiceareas": [9], "organization": "American International Automobile Dealers Association", "status_changed": "2014-12-29T04:54:27.345Z", "slug": "aiada"}, "model": "consulting.client", "pk": 5}, {"fields": {"status": "published", "body": "<p> The Alzheimer's Association is the world leader in Alzheimer research and support.

Different addictions are treated differently by the EEOC. According to Burt Fishman, an attorney with Fortney &amp; Scott, LLC, and one the nation\u2019s leading authorities on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \u201cAlcoholism is considered a disability, which entitles you to protection from discrimination under the ADA. Current illegal use of drugs is not considered a disability; however, if you are no longer using drugs and are participating in or wish to join a rehabilitation program, you can seek that as an accommodation for a recognized disability.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0In short, if you present yourself as taking steps to <i>recover</i> from alcohol or drug addiction, firing you on the basis of your going to rehab would be discriminatory. Still, your employer is only required to offer a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d for your disability; there needs to be a date when you emerge from treatment, no longer disabled. </p><p>Meanwhile remember that if your behavior doesn\u2019t comply with personnel policies, you can be terminated for cause, regardless of your disability.
